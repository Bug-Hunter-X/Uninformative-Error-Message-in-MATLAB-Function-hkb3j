# Uninformative Error Message in MATLAB Function

This repository contains a simple MATLAB function that throws an error when the input is negative. The error message is not very informative, making it difficult to debug.  The solution demonstrates how to improve the error message to provide more context and helpful information for debugging.

## Bug

The `myFunction.m` file demonstrates the issue of an unhelpful error message.  When a negative number is input, the error message simply states that the input must be non-negative, without any context or suggestions for resolution.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.m` file shows how to improve the error message by providing more detail, including the invalid input value. This makes it easier to identify and fix the problem.
